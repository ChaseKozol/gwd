# gwd
Random word generator from a specified dictionary file

Initally made to help practice learning the German language, this program essentially outputs a random line from a file named dict.txt, making it easily adaptable to other purposes.
The dictionary file I use was obtained from here: https://www1.dict.cc/translation_file_request.php

# Installation instructions:
After running the makefile, place your dict.txt file in /usr/share/dict
